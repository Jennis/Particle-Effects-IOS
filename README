 . The code uses a CAEmitterLayer to create an emitter other than using Cocos2d.
 . Getting the emmitter working is the first stage, editing the emmitter and making it work like cocos2d emitter 
    is the second stage.
 
 What I am planning to make it?
 . A Multitouch emitter.
 . Different kinds of emitter just like cocos2D.
