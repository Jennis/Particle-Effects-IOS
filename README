Update 8 may 12
I have made it to work multitouch emitter. But for it to work you have to place both finger at once. 

A MAJOR BUG.
Once you place your finger and then keep another finger, the particle is stuck to the screen. Any fixes for this will be 
awesome.


. The code uses a CAEmitterLayer to create an emitter other than using Cocos2d.
 . Getting the emmitter working is the first stage, editing the emmitter and making it work like cocos2d emitter 
    is the second stage.
 
 What I am planning to make it?
 . A Multitouch emitter.
 . Different kinds of emitter just like cocos2D.

 Are there any known bugs?
